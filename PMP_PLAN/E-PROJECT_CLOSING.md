**FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM**

**1.0 PROJECT OBJECTIVES**

The facial recognition system is done by Group B. it was intended to develop an artificial intelliegent system that have a ability to detect human faces. besides our other target we can recognize the charactewr of the human faces. that not the limitation when we also move forward in order to develop an application programming interface API for future use as the integration module.**

**2.0 SUMMARY OF PROJECT RESULTS**

After the system complete, we got accuracy around 50% from the system tested. 

**3.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL SCHEDULE**

**4.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL BUDGET**

**5.0 PROJECT ASSESSMENT**

**5.1 SCOPE**

The project scope for the facial recognition system was established at the outset of the project. For example, the system is unable to identify unique facial features that do not conform to certain predetermined criteria. Unique facial features that cannot be recognized include those that are highly reflective or have special shape. The system also limits the scope of the project to the recognition of normal facial shape only. As a result, this system may not be suitable for use people have special shape of face.

**5.2 OBJECTIVES**

Group B successfully met the objectives that were established at the start of the project. We developed an artificial intelligence-powered system that utilizes deep learning techniques. Deep learning was used to identify patterns on faces and discern facial shapes. Additionally, FAST API was implemented to integrate the Python programs used for facial recognition into an HTML website. This allowed us to achieve their goal of building an API within the system.

**5.3 IMPACTS**

When this system develop, we can easily recognize people just by usihg their faces. this can avoid from undercovered people or someone who in planning to pretending like other person. this system can be use as example in employee clock in the job time which is we cant ask for someone to clock in for us.

**6.0 TRANSITION PLAN**

Group B will provide support as needed for the facial recognition system project. Their main responsibilities for supporting the project include maintaining the system, addressing errors and updates, providing user guidelines for clients, and reporting information to senior management on a monthly basis.
