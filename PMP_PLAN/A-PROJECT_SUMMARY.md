# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
###  Project Summary
In ABC Group, there are some room and floor that are prohibited for authorized person only, currently, they using pin password to access these prohibited area. This method is insecure and hard to maintains, because they have to change the password once the password is leak or one of the authorized staff is resigned, and the others have to memorize the new password. Hence, the management decide to upgrade the system with facial recognition features.

In our Facial Recognition System, a webcame and a small display screen will be installed on the side of the door. When the visitor activate the display screen, the system will scan the visitor;s face and compared with the faces of authorized person in database. On success match, the door will open automatically, otherwise, the doorkeeper will remain locked. In maintaining the list of autorized individual, the management can add and remove an authorized person by simply add or remove the individual's image from the database.
