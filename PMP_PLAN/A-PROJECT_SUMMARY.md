# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
###  Project Summary
After connecting to the system, a camera installed on the front door of a home can automatically recognise the face of a visitor. The user is able to input their own face via mobile phone. After the user inputs their own face, the system will record it. When the user closes the door, it will lock itself automatically. When a user attempts to unlock a door, a camera will automatically scan his or her face. After a successful match, the door will open automatically. If the matching does not succeed, the doorkeeper will remain locked.
