# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

During the planning phase of the project, the Gantt Chart, which is vital to the project's success, is the primary emphasis. The Gantt Chart enables the team to adhere to the requirements and consistently reach the milestone. The work breakdown structure (WBS) of a project divides the tasks and responsibilities of each participant, such as the project manager, into distinct modules. According to the developed WBS, each member has different duties and responsibilities at each stage of the lifecycle.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

The system WBS for the Facial Recognition system are represented as follows. This WBS is designed to divide the technical portion of the project into a number of modules, including user interfaces, API management, Facial Detection, and Facial Recognition:

### Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is designed to map all relevant tasks and to develop the maintenance and approval process for the WBS.

The scope of this Facial Recognition System project must be determined. A face recognition system is expected to automatically identify faces in images and videos. It can function in either of two modes: (1) face recognition (or detection), and (2) face identification (or authentication).

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|			
|Quality <br>(Poor commitment to quality; materials, and workmanship; insufficient quality assurance programme)|1. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The system confused with facial recognition <br> (Ex. facial features of each person) <br><br> 2. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The quality of the AI model is biassed toward a set of algortihm toÂ identifiable and verifiable data that is unique and specific to the individual.  |How: The output always recognises individuals with similar facial characteristics. <br> <br> When: The quality issue of will be identified during the step of unit testing.|Continue training on detecting and finding human faces in photos while gathering data and extending the data set on a daily basis until the face match procedure certifies that two faces belong to the same individual.|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|1. Contigency: If a developer forgets to terminate the VGGFace2 instance after they are finished utilising it, the server's total cost could soar. <br><br> 2. Inadequate productivity: The members of the team who were impacted by COVID-19 are unable to deliver what they were supposed to deliver, which has resulted in the necessity to invest more funds to cover the costs of cloud servers. |How: The monthly bills display unanticipated additional charges.<br><br>When: The issue will mostly certainly be faced throughout project execution and implementation.|Notify the owner via email or Discord whenever the budget for the AWS cloud service reaches the specified threshold.
|Time <br> (Miscalculation of time and resources, erroneous identification of the important path, poor use of float, and premature introduction of competitive products.) | 1. The project did not complete its tasks by the deadline that was set on the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2.Inaccurate resource estimation: not enough servers are available to execute the training for the vehicle plate recognition model.  |How:The members are stuck with a particular problem and drag the rest of the team along with them. <br><br> When: The issue will become obvious throughout the project's phase of execution and monitoring.| To prevent a team member from becoming stuck in a problem loop, seek assistance from another team member and switch their task or job to something else.|

| Test Manager | Mohd Bruce Lee Bin Mustapa |The Test Manager coordinates the system testing of the Prime Contractor. The Manager collaborates with Quality Management to create "real-world" test data and test cases. Additionally, the Test Manager organises interface testing with external entities. They supervise testing programmes and problem reporting and resolution for prime contractors. <br><br>In this project, they will test the system and provide feedback to the developer in order to improve it. It is vital for this role to prevent confusion or accidents after release, which would cause enormous problems for the development team and company, and in the worst-case scenario, threaten the team's very existence.|
| Operations Manager | Mohd Bruce Lee Bin Mustapa |The Operations Manager is responsible for managing the new system.
