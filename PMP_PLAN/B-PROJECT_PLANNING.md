# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

During the planning phase of the project, the Gantt Chart, which is vital to the project's success, is the primary emphasis. The Gantt Chart enables the team to adhere to the requirements and consistently reach the milestone. The work breakdown structure (WBS) of a project divides the tasks and responsibilities of each participant, such as the project manager, into distinct modules. According to the developed WBS, each member has different duties and responsibilities at each stage of the lifecycle.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:
